# LL(1) grammar syntax analyzer

A program that analyzes entered set of brackets, signs and letters to match the given grammar

# Task

Correct bracket notation of arithmetic expressions with two kinds of brackets. After round brackets in a line, only square brackets can appear, after square brackets - not necessarily. Each binary operation, together with its operands, is enclosed in brackets. The correct entry may contain “extra” (double) brackets, but one letter cannot be taken in brackets.

Example.

Correct: [[((c+(a+b))*[(c-d)*a])/d]/(([a-b])/[(c+(d-a))*a])]

Wrong: [(a+b)*([a-b]-([c+a*b]/(a))+b)]
